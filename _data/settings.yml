  quote: '<p><strong>&#199;a&#287;r&#305;</strong> was born in 1974 in Germany to a family where nobody played any instruments at all, except a few talented whistlers. His first encounters with musical instruments include playing the snare drums as part of the grade school’s marching band and the electronic keyboard his father got him. However, &#199;a&#287;r&#305;`s dominating interest in electronics turned the keyboard into a spare parts source for his ongoing hobby projects. More recently, he started playing the cajon and the darbuka for United Thracians and happy to make music with a group of talented and experienced musicians who have been kind enough to let him jam along.</p>',
